    "The game progresses as follows. First, Player 1 and Player 2 are each given a random face card (K, Q, or J). Simultaneously, a community card is chosen at random. When each player decides to partake in the game, they transfer 1 unit of their balance to the pot. Each player can only see their card and the community card, and must decide whether to increase the pot by betting more or to hold their balance by checking or folding.\n",

    "A player has three moves to make in each game: raise, call, or fold. A rational player raises when they predict having a high chance of winning. For example, if I saw that I have a KK pair, I would raise the pot as much as possible, as that would result in a higher gain for me. Raising is the only attacking move that a player can make in poker. \n",
    "\n",
    "Call and fold are both reactionary moves to a raise. A rational player would call a bet when they believe that they have a good chance of winning. For example, if I have a KK pair and my opponent raised the pot, I would call the pot to stay in the game. A player would fold when they believe that they don't have a high chance of winning. For example, if I have a QJ pair and my opponent raises, I would fold to make sure that I don't lose more money than what I already contributed to the pot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another element to this game is that the player can choose how much of their balance they commit to raising the pot. If I predict having a high chance of winning, I can raise the pot by a lot. However, if I only predict having a small chance, I would only raise by a small amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, if the opposing player sees a high raise from me, they can detect me signaling my winning probability. As such, a raise that is too high will prompt the opposing player to fold so that they don't lose their winnings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, a rational player must optimize their raise such that it balances high raise with high probability of call."
