    "The game progresses as follows. First, Player 1 and Player 2 are each given a random face card (K, Q, or J). Simultaneously, a community card is chosen at random. When each player decides to partake in the game, they transfer 1 unit of their balance to the pot. Each player can only see their card and the community card, and must decide whether to increase the pot by betting more or to hold their balance by checking or folding.\n",

Raising is the only attacking move that a player can make in poker. \n",

For example, if I have a KK pair and my opponent raised the pot, I would call the pot to stay in the game. A player would fold when they believe that they don't have a high chance of winning. For example, if I have a QJ pair and my opponent raises, I would fold to make sure that I don't lose more money than what I already contributed to the pot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another element to this game is that the player can choose how much of their balance they commit to raising the pot. If I predict having a high chance of winning, I can raise the pot by a lot. However, if I only predict having a small chance, I would only raise by a small amount.\n",
    "\n",
